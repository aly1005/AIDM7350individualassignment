        <h2>NEW ALBUM - ［Übermensch］</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <div class="album-description">
            <p>［Übermensch］ is G-DRAGON's third album, which means ‘Beyond-Man’ in English. G-DRAGON stands in front of us with a stronger and tougher image than ever before.</p>
            <p>G-DRAGON injects artistry into ［Übermensch］, an album that stays truer to the essence of music than ever before. G-DRAGON has been involved in all aspects of the production, from the detailed arrangement of each track to the overall concept of the album. In addition, American singer-songwriter/drummer Anderson Paak and world-class guitarist Nile Rodgers have joined G-DRAGON's creative team to bring new ideas to his work.</p>
            <p>The album contains 8 songs, including the lead single “POWER” and “HOMESWEET HOME” and the title track “TOO BAD” and “DRAMA”. Both the title track and the album's title track are different from the previous G-DRAGON's exclusive charm.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>
                <p>The New York Times:</p>
                    <p>“G-Dragon is the 'disruptor' of Asian pop culture, breaking the formulaic framework of K-Pop and fusing music, art and fashion into a cultural phenomenon.”</p>
                <p>Rolling Stone:</p>
                    <p>“He is the 'creative core' of the Korean music industry, where every track is like an experiment, from the childlike hip-hop of 'Crayon' to the lyrical introspection of 'Untitled', his music can never be defined.”</p>
                <p>Forbes:</p>
                    <p>“As an 'iconic entrepreneur,' he not only sets musical trends, but also proves his business value through brand co-branding and art projects.”</p>
